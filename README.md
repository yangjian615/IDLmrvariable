# IDLmrvariable
Data analysis made easy.

I. Overview
The MrVariable package is a tool for simplifying data analysis. It currently has plug-ins for the MMS and BARREL missions, but the core distribution is generic enough to be useful for many other datasets. Specifically, it is able to intelligently read ASCII and CDF files, intuitively plot data, and much much more.
